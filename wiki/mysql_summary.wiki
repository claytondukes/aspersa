Get a report on important parts of your MySQL server so you can get an overview of it quickly.

Goals:

  * Give a quick view so you can decide what to dig into further.
  * Compact output; try not to line-wrap on an 80-character terminal.
  * Be as diff-able as possible so you can compare systems (or changes to the same system).
  * Work well on GNU/Linux.
  * Require only bare-bones tools such as 'sed' and 'grep' to be available.

Sample output (from the developer's laptop):
